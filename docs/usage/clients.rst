snowpatch
---------

The *snowpatch* application is a bridge between Patchwork and the Jenkins
continuous integration automation server. It monitors the REST API for incoming
patches, applies them on top of an existing git tree, triggers appropriate
builds and test suites, and reports the results back to Patchwork.
