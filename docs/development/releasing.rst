Release Process
===============

Versioning
----------

There are two types of versioning in play in Patchwork: the version for
Patchwork itself (i.e. the code or *core*) and the version for the `REST
API <../api/rest>`.

Patchwork Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 1.0, Patchwork has implemented a version of `Semantic
Versioning`__ . To summarise, releases take the format **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**
(or just **MAJOR.MINOR**). We increment:

1. **MAJOR** version when we make major UI changes or functionality updates

2. **MINOR** version when we make minor UI changes or functionality updates

3. **PATCH** version when we make make bug fixes, dependency updates etc.

In Git, each release will have a tag indicating the version number. In
addition, each release series has it's own branch called `stable/MAJOR.MINOR`
to allow backporting of bugfixes or security updates to older versions.

REST API
~~~~~~~~

The REST API also uses a variant of *Semantic Versioning*. To summarise, API
versions take the format **MAJOR.MINOR**. We increment:

1. **MAJOR** version when we make breaking changes to the API. This generally
   means removing an API or fields in an API.

2. **MINOR** version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible
   manner. This generally means adding new fields and endpoint.

These version numbers are exposed via the API and it's possible to request a
specific version in the URL. Refer to the `API Guide <../api/rest>` for more
information.


Release Cycle
-------------

There is no cadence for releases: they are made available as necessary.


Supported Versions
------------------

Typically all development should occur on ``main``. While we will backport
bugfixes and security updates, we will not backport any new features. This is
to ensure stability for users of these versions of Patchwork.


Release Checklist
-----------------

The follow steps apply to all releases:

* Documentation has been updated with latest release version

* Documentation references latest supported version of Django

* 'alpha' tag has been removed from ``__version__`` in
  ``patchwork/__init__.py``

* Commit has been tagged with an `annotated tag`__. The tag should take the
  form `v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`, e.g. `v2.0.1`. The message should read::

    Version [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]

* A `GitHub Release`__, with text corresponding to an abbreviated form of the
  release notes for that cycle, has been created

* An email describing the release and top-level overview of the changes has
  been sent to the mailing list. Refer to the emails for `Patchwork v2.0.0`__
  and `Patchwork v2.0.1`__ for examples.

The following only apply to full releases, or those where the **MAJOR** or
**MINOR** number is incremented:

* A new branch called ``stable/MAJOR.MINOR`` has been created from the tagged
  commit

Once released, bump the version found in ``patchwork/__init__.py`` once again.

Backporting
-----------

We will occasionally backport bugfixes and security updates. When backporting a
patch, said patch should first be merged into ``main``. Once merged, you can
backport by cherry-picking commits, using the ``-x`` flag for posterity:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git cherry-pick -x <main_commit>

There may be some conflicts; resolve these, uncommenting the `Conflicts` line
when committing::

   Conflicts
           patchwork/bin/pwclient

When enough patches have been backported, you should release a new **PATCH**
release.

Backport criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We consider bug fixes and security updates to the Patchwork code itself valid
for backporting, along with fixes to documentation and developer tooling. We do
not, however, consider the following backportable:

Features
  Backporting features is complicated and introduces instability in what is
  supposed to be stable release. If new features are required, users should
  update their Patchwork version.

API changes
  Except for bug fixes that resolve 5xx-class errors or fix security issues.
  This also applies to API versions.

Requirement changes
  Requirements on a stable branch are provided as a "snapshot in time" and, as
  with features, should not change so as to prevent instability being introduced
  in a stable branch. In addition, stable requirements are not a mechanism to
  alert users to security vulnerabilities and should not be considered as such.
  Users of stable branches should either rely on distro-provided dependencies,
  which generally maintain a snapshot-in-time fork of packages and selectively
  backport fixes to them, or manage dependencies manually. In cases, where using
  a distro-provided package necessitates minor changes to the Patchwork code,
  these can be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
