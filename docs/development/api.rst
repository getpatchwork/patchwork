Using the APIs
==============

Patchwork provides two APIs: the legacy :doc:`XML-RPC API <../api/xmlrpc>` and
the :doc:`REST API <../api/rest>`. You can use these APIs to interact with
Patchwork programmatically and to develop your own clients.

For quick usage examples of the APIs, refer to the :doc:`documentation
<../api/index>`. For examples of existing clients, refer to
:doc:`../usage/clients`.
