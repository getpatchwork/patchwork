Installation
============

This document describes the necessary steps to configure Patchwork in a
development environment. If you are interested in deploying Patchwork in a
production environment, refer to :doc:`the deployment guide
</deployment/installation>` instead.

To begin, you should clone Patchwork:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git clone git://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork.git


.. _installation-docker:

Docker-Based Installation
-------------------------

Patchwork provides a Docker-based environment for quick configuration of a
development environment. This is the preferred installation method. To
configure Patchwork using Docker:

#. Install `docker`_ and `docker-compose`_. [1]_ Patchwork assumes that you
   have Docker configured to allow a non-root user to manage Docker, as
   outlined in the `Docker post-install instructions`__.

  .. [1] Depending on your distro, `docker-compose` may also be available as a
        package.
  __ post-install_

  .. note::

      Mac users might need to enable Rosetta emulation in the docker engine.

#. (Optional) Create a ``.env`` file in the root directory of the project and
   store your ``UID`` and ``GID`` attribute there.

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ echo "UID=$UID" > .env
      $ echo "GID=`id -g`" >> .env

   This should only be necessary if you have a ``UID`` or ``GID`` other than
   ``1000``. For more information on why this is necessary, refer to this
   `docker-compose issue`__.

   __ https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2380

#. Build the images. This will download over 200MB from the internet:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ docker-compose build

   To use Postgres instead of MySQL, give the ``-f docker-compose-pg.yml``
   argument to ``docker-compose``.  This is required on non-x86 architectures
   as the MySQL Docker images do not have multiarch support.

#. Run ``docker-compose up``:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ docker-compose up

   This will be visible at http://localhost:8000/.

To run a shell within this environment, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm web /bin/bash

To run ``django-manage`` commands, such as ``createsuperuser`` or ``migrate``,
run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser

To access the SQL command-line client, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py dbshell

To backup the database, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py dbbackup

Likewise, to restore an older version of the database, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py dbrestore

To run unit tests against the system Python packages, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   # For MySQL database:
   $ docker-compose exec -T -- db sh -c \
         "exec mysql -uroot -p\"\${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}\" -e \"GRANT ALL ON \\\`test\\_\${MYSQL_DATABASE}%\\\`.* to '\${MYSQL_USER}'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\""

   $ docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py test

To run unit tests for multiple versions using ``tox``, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose run --rm web tox

To reset the database, stop the db container and purge the database files:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ docker-compose stop db
   $ sudo rm -rf tools/docker/db

Any local edits to the project files made locally are immediately visible to
the Docker container, and so should be picked up by the Django auto-reloader.

For more information on Docker itself, please refer to the `docker`_ and
`docker-compose`_ documentation.

.. note::

   If using SELinux, you will need to create a custom SELinux rule to allow the
   Docker process to access your working directory. Run:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ chcon -R -t svirt_sandbox_file_t $PATCHWORK_DIR

   where ``$PATCHWORK_DIR`` is the absolute patch to the ``patchwork`` folder
   created when you cloned the repo. For more information, see ``man docker
   run``.

.. note::

   If you see an error like the below::

     ERROR: Couldn't connect to the Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?

   ensure you have correctly installed Docker, and have followed the `Docker
   post-install instructions`__.

Manual Installation
-------------------

Manual installation can be used where use of Docker is not possible
or desired.

Install Required Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of different requirements for developing Patchwork:

* Python and libraries

* A supported database (RDBMS)

These are detailed below.

Python Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To develop Python-based software you first need Python. Python 3 will be
installed by default on many installations, though a suitable version can
usually be installed manually using the ``python3`` package.

It's a good idea to use `virtual environments`__ to develop Python software.
Virtual environments are "instances" of your system Python without any of the
additional Python packages installed. They are useful to develop and possibly
deploy Patchwork against a "well known" set of dependencies, but they can also
be used to test Patchwork against several versions of Django.

If you do not have ``virtualenv`` installed then you should install it now. This
can be installed using the ``python3-virtualenv`` package. Alternatively you
can install these using ``pip``.

It is also helpful to install ``tox`` which is used for running tests in
Patchwork. This can be installed using the ``python3-tox`` package, or via
``pip``.

__ https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Database Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If not already installed, you may need to install an RDBMS. You can use either
MariaDB/MySQL or PostgreSQL for this purpose. You should also install the
development headers, known as ``libmysqlclient-dev`` or ``libpq-dev``
respectively on Debian-based Debian-based distros like Ubuntu and
``mysql-devel`` or ``postgresql-devel`` on RHEL-based distros.

.. note::

   While Django provides support for `multiple database backends`__, Patchwork
   itself is only tested against MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL. Should you wish
   to use a different backend, ensure you validate this first (and perhaps
   upstream any changes you may find necessary).

.. note::

   You may be tempted to use SQLite to develop Patchwork. We'd advise against
   doing this. SQLite supports a subset of the functionality of "full" RDBMS
   like MySQL: for example, case-sensitive matching of Unicode `is not
   supported`__. You will find some tests provided by Patchwork fail and some
   patches you develop may fail in production due to these differences.

__ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/databases/
__ https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q18

Example Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example for installing all these packages and the MySQL RDBMS on Ubuntu
20.04 is given below:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev python3-virtualenv \
       python3-tox mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev

If you have an existing MariaDB/MySQL installation then you can install all
packages using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo pip install virtualenv tox

Configure Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you are interested in simply :ref:`testing Patchwork <testing>`, many of
   the below steps are not required. tox will automatically install
   dependencies and use virtual environments when testing.

Once these requirements are installed, you should create and activate a new
virtual environment. This can be done like so:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ virtualenv .venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   (.venv)$

.. note::

   If you wish to use a specific Python version, you can provide the
   ``--python`` argument to use this, e.g. ``--python=python3.11``.

Now install the packages. Patchwork provides three requirements files.

``requirements-dev.txt``
  Packages required to configure a development environment

``requirements-prod.txt``
  Packages required for deploying Patchwork in production

``requirements-test.txt``
  Packages required to run tests

We're going to install the first of these, which can be done like so:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ cd patchwork
   (.venv)$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

.. note::

   Once configured this does not need to be done again *unless* the
   requirements change, e.g. Patchwork requires an updated version of Django.

Initialize the Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One installed, the database must be configured. We will assume you have root
access to the database for these steps.

To begin, export your database credentials as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ db_user=root
   (.venv)$ db_pass=password

Now, create the database. If this is your first time configuring the database,
you must create a ``patchwork`` user (or similar) along with the database
instance itself. The commands below will do this, dropping existing databases
if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ mysql -u$db_user -p$db_pass << EOF
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS patchwork;
   CREATE DATABASE patchwork CHARACTER SET utf8;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON patchwork.* TO 'patchwork'@'localhost'
       IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   EOF

.. note::

   The ``patchwork`` username and ``password`` password are the defaults
   expected by the provided ``dev`` settings files. If using something
   different, export the ``DATABASE_USER`` and ``DATABASE_PASSWORD`` variables
   described in the :ref:`Environment Variables <dev-envvar>` section below.
   Alternatively, you can create your own settings file with these variables
   hardcoded and change the value of ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` as described
   below.

Load Initial Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before continuing, we need to tell Django where it can find our configuration.
Patchwork provides a default development ``settings.py`` file for this purpose.
To use this, export the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable as
described below:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=patchwork.settings.dev

Alternatively you can provide your own ``settings.py`` file and provide the path
to that instead.

Once done, we need to create the tables in the database. This can be done using
the ``migrate`` command of the ``manage.py`` executable:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ ./manage.py migrate

Next, you should load the initial fixtures into Patchwork. These initial
fixtures provide.

``default_tags.xml``
  The tags that Patchwork will extract from mails. For example: ``Acked-By``,
  ``Reviewed-By``

``default_states.xml``
  The states that a patch can be in. For example: ``Accepted``, ``Rejected``

``default_projects.xml``
  A default project that you can then upload patches for

These can be loaded using the ``loaddata`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ ./manage.py loaddata default_tags default_states default_projects

You should also take the opportunity to create a "superuser". You can do this
using the aptly-named ``createsuperuser`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ ./manage.py createsuperuser


Import Mailing List Archives
----------------------------

Regardless of your installation method of choice, you will probably want to
load some real emails into the system.  This can be done manually, however it's
generally much easier to download an archive from a Mailman instance and load
these using the ``parsearchive`` command. You can do this like so:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ mm_user=<myusername>
   (.venv)$ mm_pass=<mypassword>
   (.venv)$ mm_host=https://lists.ozlabs.org
   (.venv)$ mm_url=$mm_host/private/patchwork.mbox/patchwork.mbox
   (.venv)$ curl -F username=$mm_user -F password=$mm_pass -k -O $mm_url

where ``mm_user`` and ``mm_pass`` are the username and password you have
registered with on the Mailman instance found at ``mm_host``.

.. note::

   We provide instructions for downloading archives from the Patchwork mailing
   list, but almost any instance of Mailman will allow downloading of archives
   as seen above; simply change the ``pw_url`` variable defined. You can find
   more informations about this `here`__.

Load these archives into Patchwork. Depending on the size of the downloaded
archives this may take some time:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ ./manage.py parsearchive patchwork.mbox

Finally, run the server and browse to the IP address of your board using your
browser of choice:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Once finished, you can kill the server (:kbd:`Ctrl+C`) and exit the virtual
environment:

.. code-block:: shell

   (.venv)$ deactivate
   $

Should you wish to re-enter this environment, simply source the ``activate``
script again.

Django Debug Toolbar
--------------------

Patchwork installs and enables the 'Django Debug Toolbar' application by
default when using development settings and requirements. This provides a
configurable set of panels that display various debug information about the
current request/response and, when clicked, display more details about the
panel's content.

.. important::

   By default, the toolbar is only displayed if you are developing on
   ``localhost``. If developing on a different machine, you should configure
   an SSH tunnel such that, for example, ``localhost:8000`` points to
   ``[DEV_MACHINE_IP]:8000``.

For more information, refer to the `documentation`__.

__ https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


.. _dev-dbbackup:

Django Database Backup
----------------------

Patchwork installs and enables the 'Django Database Backup' application by
default when using development settings and requirements. This provides the
following management commands, which can be useful for hacking on Patchwork:

- ``dbbackup``
- ``dbrestore``
- ``mediabackup``
- ``mediarestore``

For more information, refer to the `documentation`__.

__ https://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/


.. _dev-envvar:

Environment Variables
---------------------

The following environment variables are available to configure settings.

``DATABASE_NAME=patchwork``
  Name of the database

``DATABASE_USER=patchwork``
  Username to access the database with

``DATABASE_PASSWORD=password``
  Password to access the database with<

``DATABASE_TYPE=mysql``
  Type of database to use. Options: ``mysql``, ``postgres``
