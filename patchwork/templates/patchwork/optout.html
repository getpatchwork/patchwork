  <strong>Opt-out complete</strong>. You have successfully opted-out of
  automated notifications from this Patchwork system, from the address
  <strong>{{ email }}</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please note that you may still receive email from other Patchwork setups at
  different sites, as they are run independently. You may need to opt-out of
  those separately.
</p>
<p>
  If you later decide to receive mail from Patchwork, just visit
  <a href="{% url 'mail-settings' %}">http://{{ site.domain }}{% url 'mail-settings' %}</a>,
  or visit the main Patchwork page and navigate from there.
