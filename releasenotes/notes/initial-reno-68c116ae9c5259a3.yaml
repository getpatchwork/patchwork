    REST API.

    Previous versions of Patchwork provided an XML-RPC API. This was functional
    but there were a couple of issues around usability and general design. This
    API also provided basic versioning information but the existing clients,
    mostly `pwclient` variants, did not validate this version. Together, this
    left us with an API that needed work but no way to fix it without breaking
    every client out there.

    Rather than breaking all those users, make a clean break and provide
    another API method. REST APIs are the API method de jour providing a number
    of advantages over XML-RPC APIs, thus, a REST API is chosen. The following
    resources are exposed over this new API:

    - Bundles
    - Checks
    - Projects
    - People
    - Users
    - Patches
    - Series
    - Cover letters

    For information on the usage of the API, refer to the `documentation
    <https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rest/>`__.

    Cover letters are now supported.

    Cover letters are often sent in addition to a series of patches. They do
    not contain a diff and can generally be identified as number 0 of a series.
    For example::

      [PATCH 0/3] A cover letter

    Cover letters contain useful information that should not be discarded.
    Both cover letters and replies to these mails are now stored for use with
    series.
  - |
    Series are now supported.

    Series are groups of patches sent as one bundle. For example::

      [PATCH 0/3] A cover letter
        [PATCH 1/3] The first patch
        [PATCH 2/3] The second patch
        [PATCH 3/3] The third patch

    While Patchwork already supports bundles, these must be created manually,
    defeating the purpose of using series in the first place. Series make use
    of the information provided in the emails themselves, avoiding this manual
    step. The series support implemented is basic and does not support
    versioning. This will be added in a future release.

    All comments now have a permalink which can be used to reference individual
    replies to patches and cover letters.
  - |
    `Django Debug Toolbar <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-debug-toolbar>`_
    is now enabled by defaut when using development settings.
  - |
    `Django 1.9 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/releases/1.9/>`_ and
    `1.10 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/releases/1.10/>`_ are now
    supported.
  - |
    `Python 3.5 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/>`_ is now
    supported.
  - |
    `Docker <https://www.docker.com/what-docker#/developers>`_ support is now
    integrated for development usage. To use this, refer to the `documentation
    <https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/installation/>`__.
upgrade:
  - |
    The REST API is enabled by default.

    The REST API is enabled by default. It is possible to disable this API,
    though this functionality may be removed in a future release. Should you
    wish to disable this feature, configure the ``ENABLE_REST_API`` setting to
    ``False``.
  - |
    The ``parsemail.py`` and ``parsearchive.py`` scripts have been replaced by
    the ``parsemail`` and ``parsearchive`` management commands. These can be
    called like any other management commands. For example::

      $ ./manage.py parsemail [args...]
fixes:
  - |
    When downloading an mbox, a user's name will now be set to the name used in
    the last email recieved from them. Previously, the name used in the first
    email received from a user was used.
  - |
    `user at domain`-style email addresses, commonly found in Mailman archives,
    are now handled correctly.
  - |
    Unicode characters transmitted over the XML-RPC API are now handled
    correctly under Python 3
deprecated:
  - |
    Django 1.6 and Django 1.7 are no longer supported upstream and will not be
    supported in a future release.
other:
  - |
    `reno <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reno>`_ is now used for release note
    management.
