    Series may now depend on each other. Patchwork clients may use this
    information to download and apply the dependencies when applying a series.
    This dependency relationship is shallow; the dependencies of a dependency
    should not be applied. Multiple dependencies are allowed. The order they
    are applied in is the order they appear in the content from top to bottom.
  - |
    Patchwork will now look for "Depends-on" entries when parsing mails.
    This may be done by referring to a patch or cover letter message ID in the
    commit message of a patch or the cover letter content:
    ``Depends-on: <20240726221429.221611-1-user@example.com>``
    Alternatively, the web URL of the patch or series may be given:
    ``Depends-on: http://patchwork.example.com/project/test/list?series=1111``
api:
  - |
    The API version has been updated to v1.4.
  - |
    Add the "dependencies" and "dependents" fields to the series detail view.
  - |
    Add the ``show_dependencies`` field to projects. When this field is set to
    ``True``, patch dependencies will be shown for any patches and cover
    letters received for that project.
