    Series may now depend on eachother. Patchwork clients may use this
    information to download and apply the dependencies when applying a series.
    This dependency relationship is shallow; the dependencies of a dependency
    should not be applied. Multiple dependencies are allowed. The order they
    are applied in is the order they appear in the content from top to bottom.

    Patchwork will now look for "Depends-on" entries when parsing mails.
    This may be done by referring to a patch or series ID in the commit message
    of a patch or the cover letter content:
    ``Depends-on: patch-1234`` or ``Depends-on: series-5678``
    Alternatively, the web URL of the patch or series may be given:
    ``Depends-on: http://patchwork.example.com/project/test/list?series=1111``
    This feature is disabled by default, and may be enabled by adding
    ``ENABLE_DEPENDS_ON_PARSING=True`` to the settings.py.
api:
  - The API version has been updated to v1.4.
