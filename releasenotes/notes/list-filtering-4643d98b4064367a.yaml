features:
  - |
    Allow list filtering into multiple projects (and email dropping) based on
    subject prefixes. Enable by specifying a regular expression which needs to
    be matched in the subject on a per-project basis (field ``subject_match``).
    Project with empty ``subject_match`` field (and matching ``list_id``)
    serves as a default in case of no match.
api:
  - |
    The ``/project`` endpoint now exposes a ``subject_match`` attribute.
