    Comments and whitespace are now correctly stripped from the ``Message-ID``,
    ``In-Reply-To``, and ``References`` headers. One side effect of this change
    is that the parser is now stricter with regards to the format of the
    ``msg-id`` component of these headers: all identifiers must now be
    surrounded by angle brackets, e.g. ``<abcdef@example.com>``. This is
    mandated in the spec and a review of mailing lists archives suggest it is
    broadly adhered to. Without these markers, there is no way to delimit
    ``msg-id`` from any surrounding comments and whitespace.
