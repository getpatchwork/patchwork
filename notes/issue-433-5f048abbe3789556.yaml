    Message IDs containing slashes will now have these slashes percent-encoded.
    Previously, attempts to access submissions whose Message IDs contained
    slashes would result in a HTTP 404 on some Django versions. If you wish to
    access such a submission, you must now percent-encode the slashes first.
    For example, to access a patch, cover letter or comment with the following
    message ID:

      bug-28101-10460-NydYNmfPGz@http.sourceware.org/bugzilla/

    You should now use:

      bug-28101-10460-NydYNmfPGz@http.sourceware.org%2Dbugzilla%2D

    Both the web UI and REST API have been updated to generate URLs in this
    format so this should only be noticable to users manually generating such
    URLs.
