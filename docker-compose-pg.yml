# the version of docker-compose shipped in ubuntu 16.04 is
# 1.5.2, which doesn't support version 2 syntax. Yay!
# also, v1 doesn't support explicit build args, so if you're not
# uid 1000, you will either need to manually hack the Dockerfile
# or upgrade to v2 and use the build-arg to override it.
